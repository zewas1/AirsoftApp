teams:

can be created by approved members (different user levels currently 1 admin, 0 user, elevate admin to 99, make approved user 1)
all users can see "teams" option in their menu, but only approved users+ can see a function of creating new team. Other users
see "join team" option, which allows joining any created team, which has "open for recruitment" enabled.

team managing menu from user and team owner perspective. User may not join more than one team, user can at any time leave the team.
create different event levels (solo + team events distinction in DB). Team leads can join team events if certain number of members are on that team.
only approved users (team leads)+ can see the extra events.

PENDING think about solution for when the users leave the team and it's registered for an event. (maybe notification for admin?)


SEPARATE admins can have their own ACP to control user info without accessing DB (password change, user approval, user ban)
