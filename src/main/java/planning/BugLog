1. MAJOR BUG in menu logic. When you log in with an existing user, log out and then create a new user, you cannot use
him to log in. FIXED
2. IF database is empty, you can't create a new user. FIXED
3. Select yourself for a stat-change as an admin, change your stats, check your user function of "check stats" -> should give you your new stats. fixed.
4. Minor changes requested:
 4.1 Add 'exit' option once user/admin choses 'join on-going events' option.
 4.2 Add explanatory text at admin menu/check created events/… that you can choose an event, to edit it.
 4.3 Add warning text at admin menu/create a new event… that there is an existing event live at the moment. Cant create another event, first one has to be closed.
  4.3.1 Besides, the event is created automatically once this is done. Without ability to choose ID. Multiple events might be a thing, although customizable IDs for reusability would be nice, no?
 4.4. Add a case that if there are no participating players, a ‘no players are participating’ or smth like this would be written. Instead of nothingnesssssssssss!
 4.5. Inactive events should not be shown for simple users. At least not until high scores or event/match history is implemented.
5. Review password limits. Minimum 8 symbols, max x? Bonus dev points if password symbol limit is mentioned only once the limit is breached. (ex.: password kiskiakopusteliaudamasiS1! ends up in error)
6. (Discussed) - Dissallow users of joining the same event multiple times. It allows user to do so (seen from admin menu/event/participating users as well), even if after a logout/exit & login the user remains active in the event only once.
